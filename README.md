# SQL-Internship-Tasks
The objective of this task was to learn to create databases, tables, and define relationships by designing a schema for an e-commerce platform  <br>
# Deliverables:  
* SQL Script: A script to create the database schema. <br>
* ER Diagram: A visual representation of the schema <br>
# Schema Design and Concepts.
chose an e-commerce domain and designed a schema with four main tables: customers, products, orders, and payments. 
I defined primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between these tables and ensure data integrity. <br>
* Customers table : Stores customer information with Customer_Id as the primary key.
* Products table: Holds product details with Product_Id as the primary key.
* Orders table: Links customers and products, using Customer_Id and Product_Id as foreign keys.
* Payments table: Tracks payments and links to the orders table via a foreign key, Order_Id. <br>

# ER Diagram 
This ER diagram visually represents the tables and their one-to-many relationships <br>
